💡 Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI)
Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new,
original content rather than simply analyzing existing data or
making predictions. Powered by large-scale models, often called foundation models, 
Gen AI is trained on vast and diverse datasets to learn the
underlying patterns and structures within various forms of content. This allows i
t to intelligently produce new data, including text (like essays and code),
images, videos, and audio, often in response to a simple natural language prompt 
from a user. This technology is quickly transforming numerous industries by 
automating content creation,
boosting developer efficiency, enhancing customer service through advanced chatbots
, and accelerating scientific discovery,
